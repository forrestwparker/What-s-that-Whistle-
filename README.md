# What's that Whistle?
My implementation of [Project 33: What's that Whistle?](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/33/overview) from the [Hacking With Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/) website.

#### Description
"Build a crowd-sourced song recognition app using Apple's free platform as a service: CloudKit."

Note: I do not presently have a paid Apple developer account and hence cannot use CloudKit. Section 3 is the final section I can complete at this time.
